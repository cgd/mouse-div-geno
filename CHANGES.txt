Version 1.0.2
=============
* added SNP-level tracing functionality. Various functions now allow you to
  specify which SNPs should generate detailed logging information for diagnostic
  purposes
* better parallelization. Chunk processing batches are now allowed to cross
  chromosome boundaries
* added matrix-like S3 classes which can be indexed using the same indexing operators
  used for matrices:
    - snpIntensities: contains AB intensity info. see makeSnpIntensities documentation
    - snpContAvg: contains AB average and contrast info. see makeSnpContAvg documentation
* made the process of genotyping more modular and simplified workflow for cases
  where the user is not working with musdiv CEL files: readCELFiles, genotypeSnps,
  inferGenderFromSnpContAvg, 
* function parameters that used to expect a vector of CEL file names now will
  also allow the directory containing the CEL files to be specified instead
